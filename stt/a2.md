### Que 1
1. Create a directory named week2_lab in your home folder.
```bash
	mkdir week2_lab
```
---
2. Inside it, create three files: file1.txt, file2.txt, and file3.txt.
```bash
	touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```
---
3. Move file3.txt into a subdirectory named archive/.
```bash
	mkdir -p archive/ && mv file3.txt archive/
```
---
4. List all files (long format) and redirect the output to a file named listing.txt.
```bash
	ls -l >> listing.txt
```
---
### Que 2
1. Display permissions of file1.txt using ls -l.
```bash
	ls -l file1.txt
```
---
2. Change its permissions so that only the owner has read and write access.
```bash
	chmod 600 file1.txt
```
---
3. Add execute permission for all users and verify the change.
```bash
	chmod a+x file1.txt
```
---
### Que3
1. Create a file named sample.txt with at least 10 lines of text.
```bash
	echo “What is the boy now, who has lost his ball.
    What, what is he to do? I saw it go
    Merrily bouncing, down the street, and then
    Merrily over—there it is in the water!
    No use to say 'O there are other balls':
    An ultimate shaking grief fixes the boy
    As he stands rigid, trembling, staring down
    All his young days into the harbour where
    His ball went. I would not intrude on him,
    A dime, another ball, is worthless. Now
    He senses first responsibility
    In a world of possessions. People will take balls,
    Balls will be lost always, little boy,
    And no one buys a ball back. Money is external.
    He is learning, well behind his desperate eyes,
    The epistemology of loss, how to stand up
    Knowing what every man must one day know
    And most know many days, how to stand up
    And gradually light returns to the street,
    A whistle blows, the ball is out of sight.
    Soon part of me will explore the deep and dark
    Floor of the harbour . . I am everywhere,
    I suffer and move, my mind and my heart move
    With all that move me, under the water
    Or whistling, I am not a little boy.
    ” >> sample.txt
```
---
2. Use grep to display all lines containing the word “boy”.
```bash
	grep -i -n “boy” sample.txt
```
---
3. Count the total number of lines using wc -l.
```bash
	wc -l sample.txt
```
---
4. Display all unique words in sorted order using a combination of tr, sort, and uniq. 
```bash
	tr -s “[:space:]” “\n” < sample.txt | sort | uniq
```
