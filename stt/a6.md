### Questions
#### 1. Log Analysis using grep and awk
- Create a sample file server.log containing at least 10 lines with simulated timestamps,
    status codes, and messages (INFO/WARN/ERROR).

Example:
```
2025-11-07 10:15:05 WARN High memory usage detected.
2025-11-07 10:15:08 INFO Connection from 192.168.1.2
2025-11-07 10:15:12 ERROR Failed to open database connection. 
```
---
- Use grep to extract only the ERROR lines.
```bash
grep "ERROR" server.log
```
---
- Use awk to print the 1st and 3rd columns (timestamp + message).
```bash
awk '{print $1, $2, substr($0, index($0, $4))}' server.log
```
---
- Count total ERROR lines with grep -c "ERROR".
```bash
grep -c "ERROR" server.log
```
---
#### 2. Pattern Filtering with sed and cut
- Create a CSV file students.csv with fields: Name, RollNo, Course, Marks.
---
- Display only Name and Marks columns using cut -d',' -f1,4.
```bash
cut -d"," -f1,4 students.csv
```
---
- Replace every occurrence of BSc with MCA using sed -i.
```bash
sed 's/BSc/MCA/g' students.csv
```
---
- Delete blank lines from the file.

`initially`

```bash
sed -i '/^$/d' students.csv
```
